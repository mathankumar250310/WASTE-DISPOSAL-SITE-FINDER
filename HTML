    <h1>BIODEGRADABLE WASTE</h1><br>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1 class="inr">INTRODUCTION</h1><br>
        <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 67);padding-left: 20px; font-size: 15px; padding-top: 0px;"> Biodegradable wastes are waste materials easily degraded or broken down 
            naturally by factors such as biotic (bacteria, fungi, plants, animals, etc.) and 
            abiotic (pH, temperature, oxygen, humidity, etc.). This process enables complex 
            substances to be broken down into simpler organic compounds which subsequently 
            fade into the soil. This is a natural process that could be prolonged or rapid and 
            poses little risks to the environment. These waste materials could be termed green 
            waste; including food waste, paper waste, and biodegradable plastics such are found 
            in municipal solid waste. Other examples of biodegradable wastes include sewage, 
            manure, sewage sludge, human waste, waste from various slaughterhouses, hospital 
            waste, dead animals, and plants. Biodegradable waste could be said to be recyclable 
            or reused; furthermore, bio-waste recycling may also directly contribute to climate 
            protection. They are generally known as useful waste. Recycling is one of the current waste management strategies having great benefits for the environment.<br>
            Waste can be said to be an inevitable constituent arising as a consequence of 
            domestic activities or industrial action. They have little or no value, due to the fact 
            that they generally have no alternative use. Lack of adequate waste disposal system 
            generates a great challenge for both the environment and human life. Waste can be 
            divided into biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste. Non-biodegradable wastes 
            are inorganic sources of waste that are not easily decomposed by natural agents, they 
            can remain on the planet for hundreds of decades. They are sources of great damage 
            to the ecosystem examples include plastics, batteries, glass, metal, medical waste, etc. 
            However, many of them can be recycled to produce new products.
           Biodegradable wastes are waste materials easily degraded or broken down naturally 
            by factors such as biotic (bacteria, fungi, plants, animals, etc.) and abiotic (pH, temperature, oxygen, humidity, etc.).

                <h1> Harmful Effects Of Biodegradable Waste</h1>
                <p style="margin: 20px; padding: 10px;color: rgb(0, 0, 67);">Biodegradable wastes may pollute and impact the environment in the following 
                ways:<br>
                • A large amount of microbial flora around the wastes is produced which may 
                increase the risk of communicable diseases in humans, plants, and animals 
                caused by microbes.<br>
                • Bad odor on burning may be produced due to the emission of certain gases.<br>
                • Waste collection may lead to dungeons of garbage thus promoting the carriers 
                and vectors like mosquitoes and rats to spread communicable diseases.<br>
                • Lack of biodegradable waste handling may lead to an adverse effect on climate.<br> 
                For instance, methane emission from anaerobic fermentation may result in the 
                production of landfill gas.</p>
                <h1>Management Of Biodegradable Wastes</h1>
                <p style="margin: 20px;padding: 10px;color: rgb(0, 0, 67);">Waste management could be said to be procedures and measures necessary to 
                manage waste from its commencement to its disposal stage . This involves the 
                collection, transport, treatment, and eventually waste disposal, at the same time 
                monitoring and waste management regulation process and laws governing waste, 
                economic mechanisms, and technologies. Waste management can also include the 
                reduction of waste production.
                Waste management is usually aimed at reducing the adverse effects of waste on 
                human health, the environment, planetary resources, and esthetics. A great deal of 
                waste management addresses municipal solid waste, which is largely generated by 
                household, commercial and industrial activity. It is worth noting however that waste 
                management practices are not consistent among countries (developing and developed 
                nations); regions (rural and urban areas), and residential and industrial sectors can 
                all take distinct approaches .
                Ankidawa and Emmanuel , stated that biodegradable materials constitute 
                approximately 70% of the urban waste stream in evolving economies. Disposal of 
                refuse in an indiscriminate manner is a frequent occurrence in many villages and big 
                cities across some developing countries, these waste decay, as well as the generated 
                odors, pollute the environment where they are disposed of. This will subsequently 
                lead to runoff of these decayed refuse into rivers and streams, by such means altering 
                the quality of water sources from lakes, rivers, streams, etc. which could be deleterious to humans if ingested.</p>
                <h1>Waste Handling And Transport</h1>
                <p style="margin: 20px; padding: 10px;color: rgb(0, 0, 67);">Solid waste handling can be said to include the storage, collection, transportation, treatment, utilization, processing, or disposal of solid waste, or could mean any 
                combination of such activities. Methods of waste collection vary widely among various 
                regions and countries. For instance, the world was estimated to generate about 2.2 billion tonnes of solid wastes just in the year 2020 . Of these generated wastes, a great
                percentage will be basically municipal solid waste (MSW). Certainly, the biosphere 
                system will not be able to absorb and recycle such a large amount of wastes. Hence 
                priority has to be given to the management of MSW for proper treatment and disposal 
                in order to avoid a negative impact on the environment as well as on human health.
                The domestic waste collection involves the handling in the local waste handling 
                facilities. Domestic waste collection services are often provided by local government 
                authorities, or by private companies for industrial and commercial waste. In some 
                places in the underdeveloped countries, areas, especially those in less developed countries, do not have formal waste-collection systems.
                Waste transportation means the movement of waste over specified areas by trains, 
                tankers, barges, trucks, or other forms of vehicles. Train wrecks or traffic accidents 
                can result in waste spills and releases of pollutants that may contaminate the air, 
                soil, and water. There is also the possibility of waste being released while loading or 
                unloading during transportation. Many citizens are concerned about the transportation of the waste through their communities and the risks involved. Some are as 
                well bothered that the municipal waste from urban areas may be contaminated with 
                substances that could contaminate local drinking water supplies or toxic chemicals.
                Finally, the preparation of an Impact Assessment of a potential legislative proposal 
                is of optimum importance. The objective is to look into various ways by which biodegradable waste is managed for instance in the EU, and to provide appropriate policy 
                assessment options, such as the economic, social, and environmental impacts, as well 
                as prospective opportunities/risks.</p>
                <h1>Segregation/Separation Of Wastes</h1>
                <p style="margin: 20px; padding: 10px;color: rgb(0, 0, 67);">Waste or garbage most likely could be in the form of vegetable peels or fruits, 
                wrapping materials, discarded objects, wasted food as household garbage, domestic 
                sewage or chemicals, and fertilizers discarded and washed into rivers, etc. All these 
                highlighted wastes can be segregated or separated into two basic components, as 
                biodegradable and non-biodegradable components.
                Contingent on the type of wastes, two garbage bins one for biodegradable wastes 
                and the other for non-biodegradable wastes are usually advocated. This will help in easy 
                sorting and recycling of wastes to make beneficial products. Green bins are designated 
                for biodegradable wastes like fruit peels and vegetables, tea leaves, spoiled food, tissue 
                paper, eggshells, hair, leaves, etc. Blue bins are designated for recyclable wastes like plastic waste, glass bottles, chocolate wrappers, old batteries, polythene bags, etc..However 
                biodegradable waste could be managed by employing the following techniques:<br><br>
                *COMPOSTING<br>
                *VERMICOMPOSTING<br>
                *LANDFILLS<br>
                <h1>Uses And Application Of Biodegradable Waste</h1>
                <p style="margin: 20px;padding: 10px;color: rgb(0, 0, 67);">Anaerobic digestion used to treat biodegradable waste produces digestate a 
                nutrient-rich solid material and biogas containing carbon dioxide and methane. 
                However, for the biogas to burn to produce electricity, there is a need for further 
                processing. This generated electricity can be used to power the plant. Alternatively, 
                it could be used as a transport fuel. Biodegradable waste can also be used for 
                composting or as a resource for electricity, fuel, and heat through the process 
                of anaerobic digestion or incineration . A classic example is that of Danish 
                AIKAN and the Swiss Kompogas process of anaerobic digestion of biodegradable 
                waste. While incineration can possibly recover the most energy, anaerobic 
                digestion plants retain nutrients and make compost for soil amendment while 
                still recovering some of the energy contained in the form of biogas. Kompogas for 
                instance generated 27 million Kwh of electricity and biogas in 2009. The oldest of the company’s lorries has achieved 1,000,000 kilometers driven with biogas from 
                household waste for over 15 years.</p>
